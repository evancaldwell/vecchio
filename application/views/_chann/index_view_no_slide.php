				<h3>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
		<p>		The cultivation of specimen trees is a way of life at Vecchio Trees.
				By intimately knowing and understanding our client’s vision and needs, we turn
				vision into reality. Using our creativity, expertise and industry affiliations, Vecchio
				Trees provides the highest quality products and associated services available.</p>
				<p>At Vecchio Trees, we are committed to responsible business practices that create
				ecologically balanced work and client environments.</p><br />
	<h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
	<p>As one travels through the majestic Tuscan countryside, picturesque fields of
	poppies push against golden wheat fields. The crops play a soft tune in the wind,
	beckoning you to come and sit beneath the shade of the ancient olive tree. And then
	there are the cyprus trees lining the horizon, standing strong and stately as you drift
	off into another time.</p>

	<p>The "tree" has long echoed the passage of time on any rolling hillside. At Vecchio
	Trees, our philosophy and everything we do, is simple: We want to help you
	surround yourself with what you love. We want to inspire dreams as well as
	thought. This is more than our way of cultivating and selling trees; it’s a way of life
	we highly recommend.</p>

	<p>Our unyielding commitment to quality, service and authenticity has earned Vecchio
	Trees the trust and loyalty of customers who turn to us first, time and time again.
	Indeed, we help their dreams become their reality. For if we have learned one thing,
	it's that passion inspires passion...and quality is the key to one's heart.</p>

	<p>In the journey to your vision, Vecchio Trees will inspire you, creating the arboreal
	paradise of your dreams.</p><br />
