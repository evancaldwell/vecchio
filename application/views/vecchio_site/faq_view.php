		<h3>Olive Tree Varieties</h3>
		<p class="large">The Olive tree is native to the Mediterranean region and dates back to the beginning
		of mankind, and have been in cultivation since 2,500 B.C. so there are hundreds of
		varieties. The tree is easy to grow and will tolerate many soil types, but prefers the
		soil to be well drained. Vecchio Trees offers five of the top olive tree varieties from
		around the world Arbequino, Manzanillo, Ascalono, Sevillano and the Fruitless Olive
		will add beauty to your home. Zone 8-10.</p>

		<h3>Citrus Tree</h3>
		<p class="large">Dating back to Alexander the Great the citrus tree has found its way into many
		cultures for landscapers and home gardeners in Florida, Arizona, California and
		along the Gulf Coast, a citrus tree is often the ideal choice as a landscape fruit tree.
		With its appealing shape, fragrant blossoms and edible fruit, a citrus can enhance
		any garden or estate. Zone 8-9.</p>

		<h3>Fig Tree</h3>
		<p class="large">Fig trees yield one of the great fruits of the world - mentioned in ancient texts as a
		staple of human diets since the beginning of recorded history. From our orchard’s
		you will be delighted in the beauty our figs will add to any timeline. Zone 7-10</p>

		<h3>Pomegranate</h3>
		<p class="large">The Pomegranate tree is native to ancient Persia and was cultivated over the whole
		Mediterranean region since the beginning of written history. The tree was brought
		to California in 1769 by Spanish settlers and has become a wildly popular fruit
		today. Its popularity has grown over the years not only for it’s juice but also is
		widely used as an ornamental. Zone 4-9.</p>

		<h3>Italian Cypress</h3>
		<p class="large">One cannot think of Tuscany without thinking of the magnificent cypress tree, so
		quintessential and symbolic of the Tuscan landscape that it has adopted the name
		of "The Tuscan cypress tree.” Although this is a fitting name, it is incorrect as its real
		place of origin was almost certainly Persia and was brought to the Tuscan area by
		the mysterious Etruscan tribes-people many thousands of years. Zone 5 -10.</p>

		<h3>Corkscrew Willow</h3>
		<p class="large">The Corkscrew Willow tree is a small to medium-sized, upright spreading tree. This
		deciduous tree is also known as the Dragon's Claw Willow. Perhaps best grown
		as a specimen for display of its twisted branching. Branches arise from the trunk
		at an acute angle and grow up almost parallel to the trunk before they curve back to the horizontal. The winter branch pattern is most interesting and accounts for
		the popularity of the tree. The tree tolerates any soil. It is a fast growing tree with
		narrow light green leaves. Zone 5-9.</p>
		
    	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    	<div class="col1">
            <p class="large"><strong>Where do your trees come from?</strong><br/>
            Our trees are generally grown in commercial groves in the central valley of California.</p>
  			<p class="large"><strong>Are your trees warranted?</strong><br/>
            Yes, we have a one year warranty for the olive tree only. (See Warranty specifications)</p>
  			<p class="large"><strong>Can you stop a fruiting olive tree from fruiting?</strong><br/>
            Yes, by spraying with Florel. (See Florel information)</p>
				<p class="large"><strong>Which varieties do you carry?</strong><br/>
                Manzanillo, Sevillano, Ascolano and  Hills of Santa Cruz. This can change with our purchasing of orchards. (See Olive tree variety specifics)</p>
                <p class="large"><strong>Are olive trees drought tolerant?</strong><br/>
                Yes, olive trees are drought tolerant and do well in sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and silty clay loam. Soil must be able to percolate.</p>
                 <p class="large"><strong>What are the roots like on an olive tree?</strong><br/>
                The roots are shallow and do not require very deep soil to produce well.  Hardpan or soil conditions that impede water movement may develop saturated layers that can damage the olive roots. Olive 						roots run laterally and vertically.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col2">
				<p class="large"><strong>Will olives grow in my area?</strong><br/>
				 Temperatures below 22 degrees or (-5C) will injure the branches and may cause injury to the wood and allow for bacteria. Olives are subtropical trees sensitive to hard freezing temperatures.</p>
				<p class="large"><strong>How do you remove your trees from the orchard?</strong><br/>
				Our trees are field excavated from orchards that are healthy and producing olive trees from the Central Valley. We trench the root ball on four sides and cut the bottom of the roots, then  gently lift them out of the ground. The root balls are wrapped with burlap and tied and then shrink wrapped. Our trees are removed 24 hours before shipping to you so they arrive fresh and with as little stress as possible.</p> 
				<p class="large"><strong>How are the trees shipped?</strong><br/>
				We carefully load and tarp prior to transporting. Our trees are typically shipped on a 45' flat bed.</p>
